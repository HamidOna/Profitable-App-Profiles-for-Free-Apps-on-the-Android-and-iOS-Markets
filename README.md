## Profitable-App-Profiles-for-Free-Apps-on-the-Android-and-iOS-Markets
In this project, I put my data-cleaning skills into full use. I analyse two datasets--[app store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) dataset and [google play](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) dataset simultaneously to determine what kind of free apps are profitable for a software company.
